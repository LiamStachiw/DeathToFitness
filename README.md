# DeathToFitness

This is meant to be a simple addon for World of Warcraft. The sole purpose of this addon is to encourage the user to exercise when they die on a boss.

Upon death, the addon will take the percentage of the boss's remaining health and divide it by 2. That will be the amount of a randomly selected exercise that will be suggested to the user to complete.


The suggested amount of exercise will be between 5 and 50.
